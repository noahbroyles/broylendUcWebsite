        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MacOS is a feature-packed professional operating system written by Apple. It is based off <a href="https://www.freebsd.org/">FreeBSD</a>, and uses <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XNU">Apple's UNX kernel</a>, which is based on Unix. 
            MacOS is free for everyone, although technically only <em>licensed</em> to run on Macintosh computers (made by Apple).

        <h2>Pros and Cons</h2>
        <div class="indent">
            <h3>Pros:</h3>
            <ul class="termsList">
                <li>Made for Productivity</li>
                    <p>MacOS ships with Pages, Keynote, and Numbers, Apple's free productivity suite. Microsoft Office is also fully supported on MacOS, as well as a host
                        of other professional media applications.
                    </p>
                <li>Simple, clean User Interface</li>
                    <p>MacOS's user interface is very clean and simple when compared to other operating systems, especially Windows 10.</p>
                <li>Enhanced system security</li>
                    <p>MacOS is less likely to become infected with malware. Apple is on top of security and releases security updates regularly.
                        MacOS also comes with FileVault, a full-disk encryption tool that decrypts the drive on boot and re-encrypts it when shutdown. This means that someone
                        stealing a Mac with FileVault enabled will not have much luck getting into the owner's files.
                    </p>
                <li>Compatible with other Apple systems and devices</li>
                    <p>You can sync your Mac seamlessly with iOS devices and other Macs via AirDrop, iCloud, <em>etc.</em></p>
                <li>Software is well-fitted to the hardware</li>
                    <p>Apple uses high quality hardware for Mac computers, resulting in less freezing and smooth performance. MacOS apps are designed specifically for the Macintosh hardware.</p>
                <li>Super easy multitasking</li>
                    <p>MacOS provides several different methods of multitasking, including Mission Control and dynamic desktops.</p>
            </ul>
        
            <h3>Cons:</h3>
            <ul class="termsList">
                <li>Restricted Application Availability</li>
                    <p>MacOS applications are not as common as Windows applications, simply because Windows is more mainstream in general. Not as many developers write apps for MacOS, although there is a <em>huge</em> selection of Apps that <em>are</em> written for MacOS.</p>
                <li>MacOS is not for Gaming</li>
                    <p>MacOS is geared more toward developers and professionals than gamers. This is because of the lack of super powerful graphics in Macintosh computers. Most modern video games require extensive GPU power, and 
                        most Mac computers (that are not the new <a href="https://www.apple.com/mac-pro/">Mac Pro</a> or that are not paired with <a href="https://www.apple.com/shop/product/HMT22ZM/A/sonnet-egfx-breakaway-puck-radeon-rx-560-external-gpu">an external GPU</a>) simply don't have the graphics power for gaming.
