            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will be discussing three fundamentally different operating systems in this project, <a href="macos.html">MacOS</a>, <a href="linux.html">Ubuntu Linux</a>, and <a href="windows10.html">Windows 10</a>.
            I will discuss the differences between them, pros and cons of each of them, popularity of each, features that they offer, <i>etc.</i> On this page I will give a general overview of all three.

        <h2>What is an Operating System?</h2>
        <p>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An operating system (or OS) is the base underlying software that interacts with the hardware in your computer to get things done. According to <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/361572/what-is-an-operating-system/"> How&#8209;To&nbsp;Geek</a>, an operating
            system is:
            <blockquote>
                ...the primary software that manages all the hardware and other software on a computer. The operating system, also known as an “OS,” interfaces with the computer’s hardware and provides services that applications can use.
            </blockquote>
            Logically therefore, different operating systems interact with the hardware in different ways, and provide different services. Not all OS's are created equal.

        <h2>OS Comparisons</h2>
     
        <h3>Kernel</h3>
        <p>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MacOS and Ubuntu Linux has a common ancestor, Unix. Windows 10 was not based on Linux or Unix, it was written by Microsoft and runs on their kernel, the Windows NT kernel. A kernel is the the program at the core of an operating system, that has total control of the computer's hardware.
            It is the underlying framework for the OS.
        </p>
        <h3>Shell</h3>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MacOS and Ubuntu both come with a powerful CLI shell, either bash or zsh(for newer versions of MacOS), while Windows 10 uses the horribly painful DOS batch language.</p>
