        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Windows 10 is a huge clunky operating system based on the Windows NT kernel written by Microsoft. It supports Microsoft <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_app">universal apps</a>, and includes built in touchscreen and tablet mode.</p>

        <h2>Pros and Cons</h2>
        <div class="indent">
            <h3>Pros:</h3>
            <ul class="termsList">
                <li>Windows 10 is extremely Popular</li>
                    <p>Because almost everyone uses Windows as their main operating system, compatibility with common apps is not an issue.
                    </p>
                <li>Full touchscreen support</li>
                    <p>Windows 10 was designed as much for touchscreen operation as for normal operation. With the click of a button you can out your Windows 10 PC in tablet mode. 
                        That means that you can use your laptop as a tablet while still having full computing power. This is handy and useful feature.</p>
            </ul>
            <h3>Cons:</h3>
            <ul class="termsList">
                <li>Windows 10 uses system resources heavily</li>
                    <p>Windows 10 is a system resource <em>hog</em>. It will slow to a crawl on any computer with 4Gb of RAM or less, while a Linux operating system could operated quite comfortably in the same circumstances.
                        Windows 10 is big and sloppy and wastes system resources unnecessarily because of it's poor architecture. 
                    </p>
                <li>Windows 10 degrades vastly overtime</li>
                    <p>Windows 10 will slow to a crawl even on a more powerful computer as time goes on. This is because of the horrible system architecture implemented by the Windows operating system. The size of the operating system <em>grows</em>
                    on the disk with every update, as older update files are still kept by the system and used in some way.</p>
                <li>Windows 10 is insecure</li>
                    <p>Because of the sloppy system architecture used in Windows 10, there are many loopholes in the system's security for hackers and malware. Microsoft has to release security updates almost as often as <em>once per day</em> sometimes when they find these security flaws.
                        A good antivirus software is a necessity for a Windows 10 machine connected to the internet.
                    </p>
                <li>Windows 10 costs money</li>
                    <p>Unlike most Linux distributions and MacOS, Windows 10 is <em>not</em> free. It costs around $139. Microsoft can get away with this because </p>

            <h2>Popularity</h2>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While a small chunk of PC users use Ubuntu as their main OS, the majority of Ubuntu PCs are used as servers for websites and such. Today there are over 60 million servers running Ubuntu. Linux is the main OS run on servers, and out of that a good chunk are Ubuntu machines.</p>
