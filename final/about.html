        <h2>About:</h2>
            <p>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my final project, I continued with my midterm topic, which was composed of details about three different operating systems, MacOS, Ubuntu, and Windows 10. I compare various parts of the three operating systems and give background information about each of them. 
            </p>
        <h2>Color Theme:</h2>
            <p>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I used a dark color scheme because I am a fan of the overall look of light text on a dark background, and because it is easy to focus on. I used red and green as highlight colors for links and hovering effects. My headers have pure white colored font, and my main paragraph text is white with a slight mix-in of red.
            </p>
        <h2>Layout:</h2>
            <p>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My site is fully responsive with <code>@media</code> queries. It has a three-column layout for larger screens, with a navigation area on the left side, Reddit Links on the right, and the main content in the center. When the viewportâ€™s width is decreased, the site scales back to a single column with a nav bar at the top and the Reddit links at the bottom. 
            </p>
        <h2>Checklist for Best Practices:</h2>
            <p>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most of the boxes in the checklist are checked. Some of them I did not think were necessary, as they are best practices after all and not absolute practices. The things that did not apply were marked <b>N/A</b>.
            </p>
        <h2>Extra Credit:</h2>
            <p>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For extra credit, I am using JavaScript in my site. This JavaScript oversees opening and closing the menu on the mobile version. I also use JavaScript to alert the user about what they submitted in my form and to clear the values of the form on submission.
